## Microviridae Genome Visualization Web Project

This project aims to create a website using Flask to visualize genomes and their GC percentage along the genome. It utilizes the 118 genomes available for the Microviridae family, which were previously used in a Python project.

### Project Description

#### The website will consist of the following features:

* Homepage: Users can choose a Microviridae genome from the available 118 genomes. Each genome is presented with detailed information such as LOCUS, SOURCE, TAXONOMY, GENOME SIZE, NUMBER OF GENES, and GC-content. Information is displayed in a table format for easy access.
* Virus Details Page: Displays detailed information about each selected virus, followed by an interactive chart showing its GC percentage for sliding windows of 10 nucleotides. This interactive chart is generated by a Python script using the Highcharts library.

#### Files and Directories

The necessary files and directories for this project are available on the platform. They include:

  *  microviridae.gbf: File containing all information (name, taxonomy, genome, proteins, etc.) on the 37 Microviridae present in RefSeqVirus and the 81 Microviridae generated in the publication by Roux et al. 2012.
  *  proteine_micro.faa: File containing all proteins of the 118 Microviridae. Each protein/CDS name corresponds to the "locus_tag=" field of GenBank, followed by genome name, protein/CDS coordinates, function, and sequence.
  *  proteine_micro.fna: File containing all genes coding for proteins of the 118 Microviridae, with protein/CDS names corresponding to the "locus_tag=" field of GenBank.
